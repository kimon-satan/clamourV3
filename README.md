Clamour is an interactive musical performance which playfully addresses the problem of creating meaningful realtime interactions for large numbers of participants. Using a browser-based app on their mobile phones the audience will be invited to become co-composers of the work. Subtle game mechanics will exploit tensions between the density of interactions and audience member's drive for their interactions to be audible above the rest.
